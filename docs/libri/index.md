# Tutorial: libri

Libriscribe is an **AI-powered** application designed to assist users in *writing books*. It uses a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** to guide the user through the creation process, from developing a *concept* and *outline* to writing *chapters*. The system employs specialized **AI agents** (the *Agent System*) that leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, configured through specific **LLM Prompts**, to perform tasks like character generation and content writing. All project information is stored in a central **Project Knowledge Base**, and the overall workflow is managed by a **Project Manager Agent**. Operational parameters like API keys are handled by **Configuration Settings**.
